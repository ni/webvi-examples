# Embed Content into a WebVI
This example demonstrates the ability to embed custom web content into the Web VI's front panel using LabVIEW NXG 2.0 Beta. WebVIs use HTML to define and describe the content of the front panel that will be loaded in a web page. This means that additional HTML content can be added to appear along side the LabVIEW generated HTML.

# Dependancies
- LabVIEW NXG 2.0 Beta
- LabVIEW 2009-2017 (Required for hosting only)
- Supported Web Browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

# Setup
- Clone the [ni/webvi-examples](https://github.com/ni/webvi-examples) repo to your machine.
- Open `Embed Content into WebVI/Embed Content into WebVI.lvproject`
- Run the Web VI
  - Open **Main.gviweb** and click the **Run** button
- Build Web application
  - Open WebApp.gcomp

This next section describes the content added to the Html Panel to create a web page that shows current conditions for a wind farm.

## Custome iframes
Using an open source `<iframe>` available from [DarkSky](https://blog.darksky.net/forecast-embeds/) the following snippet was inserted after the `<section id="FrontPanelCanvas">` that is generated by LabVIEW. This was used to display current weather and forcasted weather for Jersey City.

```html
<div>
  <iframe id="forecast_embed" type="text/html" frameborder="0" height="245" width="50%" 
  src="http://forecast.io/embed/#lat=39.381673&lon=-74.447348&name=Jersey City">
  </iframe>
</div>
```

Another `<iframe>` generated from [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/guide) was added to show on a map, the location of the wind turbine.
```html
<div>
  <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m8!1m3!1d12335.546909840237!2d-74.4474334!3d39.3814406!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x0%3A0x7889e374da6be88!2sACUA+-+Wastewater+Treatment+Facility!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1493839068691" 
  width="500" height="375" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen="">
  </iframe>
</div>
```

## URL Image
The **URL Image** indicator from the **Drawings** palette allows you to enter in a relative URL or an absolute URL to an external image. The **URL Image** supports both static images (.jpg, .png, etc.) and animated images (.gif, etc.).

The following external link was used from the [Jersey-Atlantic Wind Farm page](http://www.acua.com/windcam/) as the value for the **Source URL** property in the right rail of the **URL Image**.

`http://107.1.228.34/axis-cgi/mjpg/video.cgi?resolution=640x480&compression=50&dummy=1493997011112`
