# webvi-examples
- Please use all of the default namespaces and directory names when building the web application in each example.
- Fork or branch this repo and work on a single example in a single branch at a time.
- Draft the readme for each example as you go. The readme doesn't need to be perfect, but there must be something before we can pull it in.

# Embed a WebVI into Web Content
This example demonstrates how to embed a WebVI built with LabVIEW NXG 2.0 Beta into a static web page. Web applications built in LabVIEW are made up of three basic parts: 
- HTML5 Custom Elements that define the content of the page
- WebVI diagram (.via.txt) that provides the client side logic
- JavaScript and CSS files that make the web application run
Because these are the same basic building blocks (san via.txt) of all other web pages, you can pull the WebVI apart and embed it into any web content.

This example demonstrates how to create a web application with multiple pages by using multiple top-level WebVIs and Hyperlink controls to link between them. When you build the web application, each top-level WebVI generates a separate HTML file with links to the other HTML files that are generated.
