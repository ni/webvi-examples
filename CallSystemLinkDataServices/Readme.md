# SystemLink Cloud
In this section, you’ll learn how to set up, build, and connect your web application to SystemLink Cloud from LabVIEW NXG 2.1.1 Web Module.

## What You Need to Connect to SystemLink Cloud from LabVIEW 2.1.1 NXG Web Module

To connect your web application to SystemLink Cloud from LabVIEW NXG 2.1.1 Web Module, you need a server URL and an API key. The API key authenticates the web application running on your local machine for SystemLink Cloud – much like your ni.com credentials authenticate your identity.

[Learn](https://github.com/ni/webvi-examples/blob/master/CallSystemLinkDataServices/Readme.md#connecting-to-systemlink-cloud-from-labview-nxg-2.1-web-module) how to establish a connection to the SystemLink Cloud server from LabVIEW NXG 2.1 Web Module.

_Figure: Note the input differentiation between connecting to the SystemLink Cloud server from LabVIEW or LabVIEW NXG 2.1.1 Web Module vs. hosting your web application on SystemLink Cloud._

## What is an API Key?
An API key authenticates an application trying to access SystemLink Cloud. It helps to think of an API key like login credentials. When you log in somewhere, your username and password authenticate who you are and, if they’re correct, grant you access. An API key functions similarly for your application connecting to the SystemLink Cloud server.

## Obtaining an API Key
1.	Go to [Security](https://www.systemlinkcloud.com/security).
2.	Click **+ NEW API KEY** to create an API key.
3.	Click **Copy key** to save the API key.
>**Note:** You only get to see an API key once, so keep it somewhere safe and only provide it to those you trust. If you delete an API key, all applications using that API key will no longer be able to connect to SystemLink Cloud.

## Connecting to SystemLink Cloud from LabVIEW NXG 2.1 Web Module

# WebVI Details

The Call SystemLink Data Services examples uses tags and messages, which are a part of the SystemLink data services API. The Tag API is a highly scalable, lossy network commutation method that utilizes a central node to broker communication between distributed embedded, desktop, and web applications. Use Tags nodes to send and receive measurement data from one system to other systems.

The Message API communicates between systems with strings by publishing messages to topics and allowing subscribers of those topics to receive the messages. The Message API works like a queue. Therefore, if a publisher writes three messages, the subscribers dequeue and read those messages one at a time. Use Messages nodes when you need to send warning messages, status updates, or trigger events from one system to other systems.

Refer to the [SystemLink API Docs](https://www.systemlinkcloud.com/skyline-api-documentation) to find out more about the SystemLink data services API.

Use the example **Main.gviweb** to learn how these APIs can be assembled into an interactive application. Use the examples in **BasicDataServiceExamples.gcomp** for a simple overview of how these APIs are used. Use the LabVIEW examples in **LabVIEWExamples.lvproj** to see how you can interact with SystemLink Cloud from LabVIEW and LabVIEW Real-Time.

## The Main.gviweb and Main.gvi State Machine
State machines implement decision-making algorithms where a set of distinguishable states exists.

These states, or subdiagrams of code, carry out specific operations within a program.

In this example, a state is determined by the visible tab (**Read Tags** and **Write Tags**) on the panel. This means tags are only read or written when those controls and indicators are visible. In the **Read Tags** state, the controls and indicators are updated. This occurs because a control or indicator can have multiple terminals for the same control or indicator, and these terminals can be both read and write. This prevents stale values from being written to tags when the user switches tabs.

![Screenshot of State Machine](https://ni.github.io/webvi-examples/CallSystemLinkDataServices/state-machine.png)

If an error occurs or if the user clicks **Clear Faults and Reconnect**, the state machine will enter states not determined by the tab control. This logic is contained in the **Determine Next State** node.  If there is no error or if the user has not clicked **Clear Faults and Reconnect**, the **Determine Next State** node will use the state determined by the tab control. Regardless if there is an error or not, clicking the **Clear Faults and Reconnect** button will cause the state machine to enter the `initialize` state. If only an error has occurred, the state machine will enter the `error-no-systemlink state`.

# Security
For the sake of approachability and learnability this example includes username and password fields on its panel. **We discourage this practice for all applications used in production**.

Additionally, authentication credentials should not be stored in constants on the web application's diagram.  Storing credentials, such as usernames, passwords, or API keys, on the diagram could allow a malicious attacker to retrieve them by accessing the code running in the browser. We encourage you to store your credentials securely on disk but accessible via HTTPS. For example, credentials could be stored in a JSON file within the web server that is also hosting your web application.

If storing credentials in a file is not an option and you need to host your web application on-premises, you may choose to host your web application in the NI Web Server. This requires users to login to the SystemLink Web UI for authentication. Logging into this Web UI stores an authentication cookie in your browser that is automatically sent with calls to SystemLink data services. This eliminates the need to enter a username or password directly to the WebVI, either on its panel or its diagram. To do this, put the built output of your web application into the directory found at `C:\Program Files\National Instruments\Shared\Web Server\htdocs`. This is the directory for all files hosted by the NI Web Server. Please note a user can access the URL of the web application without logging in, but in order to read/write tags, they will have to login to the SystemLink Web UI at `http://localhost:9090`.

If storing credentials in a file is not an option and you can host your web application in the cloud, you may choose to host your web application on SystemLink Cloud. This requires you to have an active SSP for the LabVIEW NXG 2.1.1 Web Module and an ni.com account. Doing so allows an authentication cookie in your browser to be automatically sent with calls to SystemLink Cloud. This eliminates the need to enter an API key or server URL either in the web application.
