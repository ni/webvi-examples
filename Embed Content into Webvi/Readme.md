# Embed Content into a WebVI
This example demonstrates the ability to embed custom web content into the Web VI's front panel using LabVIEW NXG 2.0 Beta. WebVIs use HTML to define and describe the content of the front panel that will be loaded in a web page. This means that additional HTML content can be added to appear along side the LabVIEW generated HTML.

# Dependancies
- LabVIEW NXG 2.0 Beta
- LabVIEW 2009-2017 (Required for hosting only)
- Supported Web Browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

# Setup
- Clone the [ni/webvi-examples](https://github.com/ni/webvi-examples) repo to your machine.

# Details
This next section describes the content added to the Html Panel to create a web page that shows current weather conditions for Iowa State University.

## Custome iframes
Using an open source `<iframe>` available from [DarkSky](https://blog.darksky.net/forecast-embeds/) the following snippet was inserted after the `<section id="FrontPanelCanvas">` that is generated by LabVIEW. This was used to display current weather and forcasted weather for Iowa State University.

```html
<div>
  <iframe id="forecast_embed" type="text/html" frameborder="0" height="245" width="50%" 
  src="http://forecast.io/embed/#lat=42.025049&lon=-93.649156&name=Iowa State University">
  </iframe>
</div>
```

Another `<iframe>` generated from [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/guide) was added to show on a map, the location of web cam.
```html
<div>
  <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d2963.772216160839!2d-93.64865408435193!3d42.02661867921068!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x87ee7a0a5e215b19%3A0xd7d8ed3aee6c49e8!2sIowa+State+University!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1494614524319"
  width="500" height="375" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen="">
  </iframe>
</div>
```

## URL Image
The **URL Image** indicator from the **Drawings** palette allows you to enter in a relative URL or an absolute URL to an external image. The **URL Image** supports both static images (.jpg, .png, etc.) and animated images (.gif, etc.).

The following external link was used from the [Iowa State University Web Cam Page](http://www.fpm.iastate.edu/webcam/isucam/) as the value for the **Source URL** property in the right rail of the **URL Image**.

`http://129.186.47.239/axis-cgi/mjpg/video.cgi?resolution=4CIF&dummy=`
